#### 30<sup>th</sup> November, 2022

First project. The learning goals are as follows - learn how to:

1. Navigate the filesystem
    
    ```bash
    cd # Changes the directory
    pwd # prints the current working directory
    ls # lists contents of a directory
    ```

2. Look around

    ```bash
    ls
    less # helps view files content
    file # tells us the kond of file we have
    ln # Creates links to files or directories
    ```

3. Manipulate Files

    ```bash
    cp # Copies files and directories
    mv # Moves or renames files and directories
    rm # Removes files and directories
    mkdir # Creates a new directory
    ```

4. Work with commands 

    ```bash
    type # Tells us about a command
    which # Tells about the location of a command
    help # Displays all shell available commands
    man # Tells us how to use a command
    ```

5. Know what the shell is all about.
6. Understand the shebang
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    ```
